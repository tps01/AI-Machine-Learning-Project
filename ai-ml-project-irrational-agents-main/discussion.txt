We talked with Kyle, Tristan, and Seanâ€™s group about the implementation of CSV dictionary readers, use of the Node class, 
and how the DecisionTreeLearning() function should traverse through the data set. We also helped them with the tree printing algorithm.
Tom drew Kyle a diagram of of how the algorithm moves through branches.

Tom also came to the computer lab to ask about the confusion matrix values. (Thank you)
