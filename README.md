# AI-Machine-Learning-Project
This was a group project for my AI class with Prof. Fitzsimmons. I worked with Jackson Hoy. It implements the decision tree learning algorithm,
and it also has the option of pruning decision trees. Decision tree learning is a common way to train an AI with a training and test set.
You need a python environment on your system to run this program. (We used python3)
There is an additional readme within the project folder that specifies how to run the program.
